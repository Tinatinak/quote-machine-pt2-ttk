# Welcome to the quote machine!

This app is built using React, Redux toolkit and is written in typescript and shows a quote and who said it. 

You can see a preview of the app to the right. 
To open up Dev tools for the preview, use the icons at the top of the preview window.

## Task

There are multiple challenges to implement, choose two that you are comfortable with and that take a reasonable amount of time. 

Fork this sandbox and implement your choice of challenges:

1. Show the number of times a quote has been viewed
2. Add a new quote (quote text and author)
3. Upload a json file like the upload-quotes.json and add them to the quotes available
4. Upload a csv file like the upload-quotes.csv and add them to the quotes available

For the upload tasks there is a skeleton component in the upload directory with example files to upload. You can add node packages using the package.json file if you need it.

Good luck!
